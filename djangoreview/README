Running the project:
    1- Clone this repo

    2 - Create a virtualenv with python 3.6:
        virtualenv djangoreview --python=python3.6

    3 - Create a database named djangoreview (change the settings with your postgres user and password)

    4 - Run migrations
        python manage.py migrate

    5 - Create a superuser.
        python manage.py createsuperuser

    6 - Run server
        python manage.py runserver
    Now the server is running in localhost.

Usage: 

    Registration with django rest-auth on url /rest-auth/registration

    Login on /rest-auth/login

    Logout on /rest-auth/logout

    The review api is on /reviews

    Only logged in users can post reviews, a GET method on /reviews will only return the reviews submitted by the logged user, except for the superuser, that can receive all the reviews.
